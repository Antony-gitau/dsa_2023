# [Dsa_2023](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2023kigali/)

This repo contains my exploration during the DSA 2023.

We have R scripts and python jupyter notebooks (some are named after a session).

The naming of scripts is based on the data explored on that script.

The toy data is also in this repo and is in xlxs format.
